  福登's future is a challenge for 曼城和主帅瓜迪奥拉

评述和分析：尼克-莱特

福登本赛季仅在英超上场93分钟

布拉欣-迪亚斯跟随桑乔离开曼城的决定使得福登成为了人们关注的焦点。 So what are the prospects of their great academy hope now forcing his way into the team? 这对于福登本人和球队来说都是一项挑战。

在2017年5月，在结束瓜迪奥拉执教曼城的第一个赛季，并且收获英超第三名成绩不久之后，  曼城主席穆巴拉克接受了一次采访，采访中他赞赏了球队的未来，以及and the three young players he hoped would form a key part of it.

"What makes it special this year especially is that we have three or four players that we genuinely believe have a very good chance of making it to the first team. You look at 桑乔, you look at  福登, you look at 迪亚斯. They are extremely talented players. If you ask Pep today, he will tell you they can and will be first-team players at Manchester City."

穆巴拉克对曼城未来的兴奋显然是没有任何问题的，同时他对球队三颗冉冉升起的新星的潜力也是估计正确的。但是问题显然是其中两人正在其他球队兑现自己的天赋。 在穆巴拉克的上述评论之后，桑乔迅速和曼城切断了关系，之后迪亚斯也在这个月早些时候转会至皇家马德里。

It is a damning indictment of the lack of opportunity in the Premier League that a young player like 迪亚斯 feels he will get more chances with 13-time European champions Madrid than he would at City, 但是他和桑乔并不是仅有的失去耐心的球员。

The stream of young players moving abroad is gaining momentum, with 切尔西的 奥多伊, a £35m target for 拜仁慕尼黑, 就是下一个潜在的引起轰动的流出。

这一趋势促使英超的俱乐部做出一定的自我反省。 It also adds to the intrigue surrounding what happens next with 福登 at Manchester City.

The 18-year-old, a City player since the age of eight, is an exceptional talent who counts 瓜迪奥拉 among his most vocal admirers - 曼城的老板最近表态："他将会陪伴我们很多很多年，但是就目前而言，在一线队的出场机会是有限的。"  

福登 has featured in eight Champions League and cup fixtures this season, 也有三粒入球进账。但是在英超联赛中，自他18个月前的首秀以来，他只踢了139分钟。在周日对阵主帅下课的哈德斯菲尔德的比赛中，尽管球队自第56分钟起就以三球优势领先，他还是没有登场比赛。

福登 has given no indication that he sees his future elsewhere and并且人们还应该 it is also important to remember that he is still four months shy of his 19th birthday, but he could be forgiven for casting envious glances towards his old academy team-mates on the continent.

福登和桑乔在年龄上仅相差两个月，但是自桑乔于2017年从曼城转会到多特蒙德，后者已经在德甲联赛中登场1797分钟， earning three England caps and 并且赢得了欧洲最火爆的年轻球员之一的美誉。同时，迪亚斯, meanwhile, has made three senior appearances in little more than two weeks since joining Madrid.

福登, Golden Ball winner during England U17s' World Cup triumph in 2017, is regarded by some as the most talented of the trio, but competition for places in City's midfield could hardly be tougher. In addition to having Fernandinho, Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan on the pitch on Sunday, City had David Silva and Bernardo Silva alongside 福登 on the bench.

On the one hand, 福登 could not ask for a better set of players to learn from. 他最近说：“我们有最出色的球员，最优秀的工作人员，所以我正处在正确的位置。我每天都从他们身上” 
"We've got the best set of players and the best staff so I'm in the right position, I'm learning off them every day, so I couldn't be in a better place. It's brilliant to play alongside players like Kevin De Bruyne. You just learn from the best."

But on the other hand, it makes the task of breaking into the team far harder. David Silva turned 33 earlier this month. The idea is that 福登 will one day succeed him in City's midfield. But with nine goals in 27 appearances so far this season, the Spaniard is showing no imminent signs of slowing down.

瓜迪奥拉 has preached patience with 福登, 坚称他在未来将“有很多上场机会”，但是在目前这个对他发展至关重要的阶段，  but at this crucial stage in his development, the onus is on City to be brave with him now. 这名18岁球员已经足够优秀，这一点无需多言，穆巴拉克和瓜迪奥拉都已经知道。 现在问题的关键是给他足够的出场时间来让他展现自己的天赋。
